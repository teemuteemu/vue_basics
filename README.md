# Dummy Vue project

"Notes to self" kind of dummy app using Vue 2.0, Vue-router and Vuex.

Total beginner thing still so mistakes are guaranteed and best practices are still to be discovered.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
